# Project Proto

This is a self driven and self taught project to create a prototype for my future survival video game idea. The project is changing everyday as I work to continuously add features and brainstorm ideas.  All current ideas being planned for the game are hosted on a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/wrnnROg2/version-1) so if there are any questions on how the project is coming along, go ahead and look at that board.  I am trying my best to mark down as many progress marks as I can as well as update it with all the features I'm wanting to add.
